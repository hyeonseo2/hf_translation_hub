## ✨ What is this?

**hf-translation-hub MCP Servers** is a collection of **Model Context Protocol (MCP)–compliant servers**
designed to automate and standardize **Hugging Face documentation translation workflows**.

Rather than providing a single, monolithic UI agent, this project exposes **translation-related capabilities as independent MCP servers**.  
These servers can be orchestrated by external AI agents to build flexible, scalable, and inspectable translation pipelines.

Inspired by the original *i18n-agent*, this project focuses on **agent-native, server-side tooling**.

The MCP servers enable agents to:

- 🔍 **Discover** untranslated or outdated documentation files
- 🤖 **Translate** technical documents with context awareness and structure preservation
- 🧪 **Review** translation quality, terminology, and formatting consistency
- 📝 **Create** GitHub pull requests automatically

---

## 🎯 Why MCP Servers?

Documentation translation is not a single action—it is a **workflow**.

Based on the project overview, the core problem identified was that traditional approaches
bundle discovery, translation, review, and PR creation into tightly coupled systems,
making them hard to reuse, automate, or adapt.

This project adopts a **multi-server MCP architecture** to solve that problem:

- Each MCP server has a **single, well-defined responsibility**
- Agents can **compose only the steps they need**
- Each step is **explicit, inspectable, and retryable**
- Workflows can evolve without rewriting the entire system

This design supports:

- 🤖 Fully autonomous translation agents
- 🧑‍💻 Human-in-the-loop translation workflows
- 📦 Batch and incremental localization pipelines
- 🔁 Continuous documentation updates

## 🚀 Quick Start (MCP Usage)

These MCP servers can be used from any MCP-compatible client, including:

- Claude Desktop (MCP)
- HuggingChat MCP
- Custom Python / Node.js agents
- n8n MCP workflows

### 🔍 Step 1: Discover translation targets

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": "call-1",
  "method": "tools/call",
  "params": {
    "name": "hf_translation_docs_explorer_search_files",
    "arguments": {
      "project": "transformers",

      "limit": 10,
      "include_status_report": true
    }
  }
}

      "target_lang": "ko"
    }
  }
}
```

Each step is optional.
Agents may stop after translation, insert custom validation logic, or replace steps as needed.
